# Image Manager APIs - Digital Asset Manager (Sample UI)

This package is provided as an easy way to get started using Akamai's Image Manager APIs.  API Reference can be found at https://developer.akamai.com/api/imaging/imaging/reference.html

This Application illustrates how all of the Image Manager APIs can be used.

In order to use the DAM, you will need a set of Image Manager {OPEN} credentials, and the API token generated when enabling Image Manager in Property Manager.

``` js
{
	"openConf":
	{
		"client_token":"xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
		"client_secret":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=",
		"access_token":"xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
		"base_uri":"https://xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.imaging.akamaiapis.net"
	},
	"purgeConf":
	{
		"host":"https://xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.purge.akamaiapis.net",
		"client_token":"xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
		"access_token":"xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
		"secret":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=",
		"max-body":4096
	}

cd <path_to>/imaging-sample-ui
./run.sh
```
You may need to ```chmod 775 run.sh``` before you can run the program.

### Windows Systems
Open cmd.exe
```cmd
cd <path>
node OPENwrapper/index.js
```

## Runtime Options
The following options are supported when launching the application

#### Port

node OPENwrapper/index.js -c /path/to/config.json
```

This will run the server with the specified configuration file which **MUST** be valid JSON. If you haven't changed the configuration, it should be running at [http://localhost:8421](http://localhost:8421)

## DAM UI Deployment

### Install Bower Package Manager

Bower is a package manager used to retrieve web project dependencies.

#### Unix-based Systems
To install, run

```
npm install -g bower
```

Then run the following command to install the project dependencies.

```
bower install
```

Ensure all libraries are in ```OPENwrapper/webapp/bower_components```
 or update ```OPENwrapper/webapp/index.html``` if you placed them elsewhere

#### Windows Systems

Download the following libraries

+ [Angular 1.3.8 and Angular Route Module 1.3.8](https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/downloading)
+ [jQuery 2.1.3](http://jquery.com/download/)
+ [Bootstrap 3.3.2](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)


Place the libraries in ```OPENwrapper/webapp``` and update the paths in the ```OPENwrapper/webapp/index.html```

## Accessing the DAM once it is launched

Launch a web browser and navigate to the web server URL. The default URL on the system it is running on should be http://localhost:8421

If you are accessing the DAM from another machine you should connect to http://[host_server_ip]:8421
